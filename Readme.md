# Solar Panel Analysis Project --> Differ Community Power

## Overview
DCP is seeking to take on long-term operations contracts; either in the form of 5-10 year O&M contracts on previously installed sites, or a 15-20 year Fee for Service (F4S) model
This motivates operating sites cost-efficiently, as DCP profitability margin becomes dependent on whether sites can be operated and maintained for the duration of the contract period
Thus it becomes necessary to:
-1)Obtain an overview of the various operation and maintenance costs, and how subcomponents of these costs compare in terms of size in a lifecycle perspective
-2)Identify measures that DCP can act on in the short- and long-term to reduce the overall costs of operating sites

###This project focuses on the analysis of solar panel performance across different sites in Malawi. 
The goal is to assess the impact of various factors such as soiling, shading, and broken panels on solar energy production.
We will take a cross-sectional where we will compare normalized production across different health sites that have Differ solar panels installed.
